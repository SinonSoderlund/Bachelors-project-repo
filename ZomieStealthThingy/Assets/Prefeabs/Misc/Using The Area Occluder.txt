When setting up the occlusion area you may want to have the Sprite Shape Controller settin "Update Colliders" On, however you should turn this setting of as you edit/add more colliders in order to configure the 
areas outside of the occluded are where the area becomes unoccluded. Furthermore remember to make sure that all colliders are set as triggers.
